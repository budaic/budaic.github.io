                <h2>Research: End-to-end RL on F1Tenth</h2>
                
                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    At HUN-REN SZTAKI, I have been working on developing end-to-end reinforcement learning 
                    based agents for racing in the <a href="https://f1tenth.org">F1Tenth competition</a>.
                </p>

                <h3>F1Tenth problem</h3>
                <ul class="technical-list">
                    <li><strong>Input:</strong> LiDAR sensor data for environmental perception</li>
                    <li><strong>Output:</strong> Speed and steering commands for vehicle control</li>
                    <li><strong>Task:</strong> Race autonomously through a track bounded by HVAC tubes, avoiding obstacles and overtaking opponents</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Our work</h3>
                <p>
                With my friend Tamás Széles we decided to attempt an end-to-end RL approach. No previous team had successfully done this before us.
                <br>We took the following steps:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        created a simulator environment from scratch,
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        trained an agent to control the car,
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        created a domain randomization technique to facilitate the transfer,
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        raced the car successfully in the competition.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                Our approach first got 12th place in Yokohama, and after further developement 5th place in Milan. 
                We are proud that because of its agentic nature, our car was able to do many overtakes during the competition, while even the best teams were rarely able to do so.</p>
